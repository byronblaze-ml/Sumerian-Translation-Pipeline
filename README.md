# Sumerian-NER
UrIII Named entity recgonation and POS tagging
This Repo contains the raw and final Dataset for the Named Entity recgonation and POS tagging for sumerian language.

The tags/symbols(ORACC Version) for NER and POS can be observed here - https://cdli-gh.github.io/guides/guide_tagsets.html

# Cleaned_Data
Since the Named Entity Recgonation and POS tagging depends on different symbols of raw data (extracted text), it does not require a deep cleaning. Cleaned Data repo contains the final data in csv format containg columns (Text, NER tag and/or POS tag) which can be used directly for the model. 

# AIM
The aim is to build a pipeline for the NER and POS tagging of URIII langauges, either using Neural Networks of Rule Based approach
